## Eigenface

This program is to generate eigenfaces.

Let's say we have 5 different persons (or classes) with 5 images per person. 

So, we will store them in 5 different folders naming 's1', 's2', 's3', 's4', and 's5'.

In the code, set `im_class` to 5 and `im_per_folder` to 5. 
Also, set `N` is equal to 10 to see top ten eigenfaces.

That's it! Run the code.

It will show the following outputs - 

- some samples of the images
- mean image
- top `N` eigenfaces
- eigenvalue curve
- variance curve
